# Plague-Inc.-Personal-Records-Calculator
**So far, the only complete thing I've ever made in Python.**

The "Plague-Inc. Personal Records Calculator" is a simple Python script that calculates a score based on user input for the score, biohazards, time, cure progress, and difficulty level of any given played game of Plague Inc. It assigns multipliers to the four difficulty levels, prompts the user for input, calculates the final score using the provided values and difficulty multiplier, and then displays the final score.

There's even a Facebook post about it: https://www.facebook.com/share/p/PrSH2fMfQPwBUDJm/
